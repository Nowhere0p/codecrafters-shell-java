# My Shell Implementation in Java

This repo contains my solution to the "Build Your Own Shell" challenge from Codecrafters, where the goal is to build a custom POSIX-compliant shell in Java. Along the way, I'll implement essential shell features like parsing commands, running external programs, and creating built-in commands (such as `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.).

---

## Challenge Overview

The challenge requires building a functional shell from scratch. You’ll write your own command interpreter, manage process execution, handle built-in commands, and create an interactive shell loop. It’s a great way to learn more about how shells work under the hood.

- **Stage 1**: Basic setup, just get the shell running.
- **Stage 2**: Add built-in commands like `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, and more.
- **Later Stages**: Implement external command execution, handle arguments, process management, and error handling.

I’ll be documenting my progress and pushing the changes as I move through each stage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nowhere0p/codecrafters-shell-java.git
   cd codecrafters-shell-java

1. Ensure you have `mvn` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main/java/Main.java`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
